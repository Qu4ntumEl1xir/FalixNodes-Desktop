## ‚ùî Q&A for Developers
### Why is Font Awesome included offline? You could use a script instead.
#### What is Font Awesome?
Font Awesome is a font and icon toolkit based on CSS and Less.

[Learn More](https://fontawesome.com/)

[Learn to Upgrade](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/how-to-use/on-the-desktop/setup/upgrading-from-version-4)

#### Why include it offline?
I understand that using one line of code, in this case a link to the Font Awesome script, will do the trick. Yes, you can do that, but the reason why I'm including Font Awesome locally with the software is for offline usage. 

If the user is offline, the icons in the software won't load unless Font Awesome is included locally.

### Why all these requirements to just build it?
The reason why the software needs all these requirements like Python and Visual Studio(Desktop Development with C++) is because of technology that was coded into the software like [Glasstron](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glasstron) for visual appeal and [XTerm](https://xtermjs.org/) for the built-in terminal to use FalixCoins Miner with.

### Why Electron?
#### What is it?
Electron is an open-source software framework developed and maintained by GitHub. It allows for the development of desktop GUI applications using web technologie. It combines the Chromium rendering engine and the Node.js runtime. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework))

#### Why I use it
I, Korbs, am mostly comfortable and knowledgeable with web coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Using Electron was the right approach for me, and I've acquired a huge amount of experience with it over the last three years. The process of doing cross-platform support was also shortened and easier for me to do.

There are tons of other good reasons why to use Electron, you can read more about that here on [Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/what-is-electronjs-and-why-should-you-use-it_581971) (Article).

## Push Notification
### What is it?
A push notification works simiar to a native notification, where it pops up like any other notification. With push notifcations, the developer can send a notification at any time he or she wants. Since we're doing this in Electron, the app has to be opened to see the notification. I could let the app run in the background after it closes, but I refuse to, as that could have an impact on performance. -->

## üîß Preparing to Build
### Requirements
 - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) 14.16.0 or above
 - [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.9 or above
 - G++ (Linux)
    - Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install g++`
    - Fedora: `dnf install g++`
 - [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (Install Desktop Development with C++) (on Windows)
 - [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads-2647da03-1eea-4433-9aff-95f26a218cc0) (on Windows)
 - At least 8GB of storage

### Downloading Source Code
#### Using Git
If you have Git already installed, run the following command to download and automatically extract the source code from our GitHub:
```
git clone https://github.com/FalixNodes-Software/Desktop-App/
```

#### Using GitHub CLI
If you have GitHub CLI already installed, run the following command to download and automatically extract the source code from our GitHub:
```
gh repo clone FalixNodes-Software/Desktop-App
```

If you don't have Git or GitHub CLI installed, you can download it manually from our [GitHub](https://github.com/FalixNodes-Software/Desktop-App/) or install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) or install [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/).

You can also download the source code manually and go from there.

### Other Modifications
There are some other assets you may need to change if you're forking this repo for another host or for a simliar project. Assets for the background images, names, etc need to be changed as they may contain resources from Falix or the name "Falix" in general. You also need to update other stuff like the update server provider and learn how it works if you do plan to include auto updating like we did.

#### Auto Updates
As seen here in the __[package.json](https://github.com/FalixNodes-Software/Desktop-App/blob/master/package.json#L47)__, there is a url "https://updates.korbsstudio.com/falix-software/", which is a self hosted update server. 

The file structure is simply, you're required to have a "latest" file in there like `latest.yml`, `latest-mac.yml`, and a `latest-linux.yml` file along with a setup file for the software. 

If you don't plan to self host your own update server, then GitHub Releases is recommended.
Simply change the publish area of the package.json file to this:
```
...
    "publish": {
      "provider": "github",
      "repo": "repo-name",
      "owner": "owner-username",
    },
...
```
You're required to have your GitHub token to publish new releases with Electron Builder, so add the token to the environment.

On Linux/macOS:
``` 
export GH_TOKEN="<YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>"
```

On Windows:
```
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("GH_TOKEN","<YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>","User")
```

Make sure to restart your terminal after doing the export command.

#### NSIS Setup
<img width="450" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/499/0*fMHZpJv5BjlmnJE4.png">

As shown above, there is an image shown in the left sidebar of installer. This can be changed by updating the image in `/build/installerSidebar.bmp`. Image size has to be 164x314 pixels.

Just download the [Figma file](https://github.com/FalixNodes-Software/Desktop-App/tree/master/build/assets/figma/Falix Software Resources.fig) for this and simply update the screenshots. Or if you want, you're allowed to create your own image for the sidebar.

What's a BMP file? The BMP file format, also known as bitmap image file, device independent bitmap file format and bitmap, is a raster graphics image file format used to store bitmap digital images, independently of the display device, especially on Microsoft Windows and OS/2 operating systems. In this case, we're using NSIS, which requires the use of BMP.

#### DMG Setup
<div>
  <img width="450" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/829662493533667339/862790846201331762/unknown.png">
</div>

As shown above, there is background image shown in the DMG installer. This can be changed by updating the image in `/build/background.png`. Image size has to be 540x380 pixels. The only objects in the image above that isn't part of the background image is the __falixnodes.app__ file and the Applications folder shown in the center.

### Building
#### Installing Dependencies
FalixNodes Software uses Electron and other required packages to run the app and uses Electron Builder to package it up nicely. Run the following commands to install them:
```
npm install install
```

### Running
After all required dependencies are installed, you should be able to run the software with the start command provided in __package.json__.

To run the start command, simply run the following command:
```
npm start
```

### Create a Package
Wanna create an installer? You can do this with Electron Builder, there is already a build command ready which is provided in __package.json__.

To start building the installer, run the following command: 
```
npm run build
```

After installer is done building, check the `/dist/` folder.
